# 150 Days Master Roadmap to MAANG/FANG/GANG

A comprehensive 150-day coding journey to master algorithms and data structures for top tech company interviews.

## Problems

| Day | Problem | File | Complexity |
|-----|---------|------|------------|
| 1 | Two Sum | `two_sum.py` | O(n) time, O(n) space |
| 1 | Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock | `best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock.py` | O(n) time, O(1) space |
| 1 | Majority Element | `majority_element.py` | O(n) time, O(1) space |
| 1 | Merge Sorted Arrays | `merge_sorted.py` | O(m+n) time, O(1) space |
| 1 | Move Zeroes | `move_zeroes.py` | O(n) time, O(1) space |
| 1 | Squares of Sorted Array | `squares_sorted.py` | O(n) time, O(n) space |

## Quick Run

```bash
python day1/two_sum.py
python day1/best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock.py
# ... etc
```
